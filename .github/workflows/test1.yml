      # Step 2: Install Python on the runner
      # This sets up a Python environment for the workflow

        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run the Flask application

      # NOTE: This runs temporarily and stops when the job finishes
      - name: Run app
        run: |
          python app.py
